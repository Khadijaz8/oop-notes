# ðŸŒŸ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Easy Explanation

Welcome! This repository contains a beginner-friendly explanation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using simple language and real-world examples.

## ðŸ“˜ What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a way of writing computer programs where you design your code based on **real-world objects**.

Think about real-life things like a **car**, **student**, or **bank account** â€“ each has properties and behaviors. OOP helps you model these in code using **classes** and **objects**.

## ðŸ§± Key Concepts (With Examples)

| Concept         | Simple Explanation                                                    | Example                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Class**       | A **blueprint** to create similar objects.                             | `Student` class defines students. |
| **Object**      | A **real item** created from a class.                                  | `student1 = Student("Ali", 22)` |
| **Attributes**  | Data stored in an object (like properties).                            | Name, Age                        |
| **Methods**     | Functions that an object can perform.                                  | `student1.study()`              |
| **Inheritance** | One class **inherits** features from another.                          | `ElectricCar` inherits `Car`.   |
| **Encapsulation**| **Hides** internal details and protects data.                          | You use a method without knowing its internals. |
| **Polymorphism**| Same method name, different behaviors in different classes.            | `draw()` in both `Circle` and `Square`. |
